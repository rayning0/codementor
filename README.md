# CodementorX Projects

Code related to [Codementor](https://codementor.io) and [CodementorX](https://hire.codementor.io) freelance projects.

CodementorX is an invite-only network of top software and app developers available for hire.

CodementorX is the top 2% of Codementor's network of expert developers, including engineers at Silicon Valley companies, startup CTOs from top accelerators, top Stack Overflow answerers, and experienced freelance web and mobile developers.

I was invited by Codementor staff to join.
